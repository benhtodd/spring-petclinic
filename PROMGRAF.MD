## Custom metrics monitoring

Grafana and Prometheus are included in the `docker-compose.yml` configuration, and the public facing applications
have been instrumented with [MicroMeter](https://micrometer.io) to collect JVM and custom business metrics.

A JMeter load testing script is available to stress the application and generate metrics: [petclinic_test_plan.jmx](spring-petclinic-api-gateway/src/test/jmeter/petclinic_test_plan.jmx)

### Using Prometheus

* Prometheus can be accessed from your local machine at http://localhost:9091

### Using Grafana with Prometheus

* An anonymous access and a Prometheus datasource are setup.
* A `Spring Petclinic Metrics` Dashboard is available at the URL http://localhost:3000/d/69JXeR0iw/spring-petclinic-metrics.
You will find the JSON configuration file here: [docker/grafana/dashboards/grafana-petclinic-dashboard.json]().
* You may create your own dashboard or import the [Micrometer/SpringBoot dashboard](https://grafana.com/dashboards/4701) via the Import Dashboard menu item.
The id for this dashboard is `4701`.

### Custom metrics
Spring Boot registers a lot number of core metrics: JVM, CPU, Tomcat, Logback... 
The Spring Boot auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of requests handled by Spring MVC.
All those three REST controllers `OwnerResource`, `PetResource` and `VisitResource` have been instrumented by the `@Timed` Micrometer annotation at class level.

* `customers-service` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
  * @Timed: `petclinic.owner`
  * @Timed: `petclinic.pet`
* `visits-service` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
  * @Timed: `petclinic.visit`
